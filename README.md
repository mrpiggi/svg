Summary
-------

The **svg** package provides an user&#8209;interface for automated integration
of SVG&nbsp;graphics created with ***Inkscape*** into LaTeX&nbsp;documents.
Therefor the capabilities provided by ***Inkscape***&mdash;and its command line
tool&mdash;are used to export the text within a SVG&nbsp;graphic to a separate
file, which is then rendered by LaTeX. The two commands `\includesvg` and
`\includeinkscape` are provided as central user&#8209;interface, which are very
similar to the `\includegraphics` command of the **graphicx** package.

In addition, the package **svg-extract** extends the user&#8209;interface of
package **svg** in order to support the extraction of these graphics into
independent files in different graphic formats, exactly as they are rendered
within the LaTeX&nbsp;document. For the creation of these graphics in the
well&#8209;known formats PDF, EPS and&nbsp;PS, LaTeX and possibly conversion
tools shipped with the most LaTeX distributions are used. If the graphics are
required in other file formats, either ***ImageMagick*** or ***Ghostscript***
can be invoked.

  naming exported graphics after their consecutive numbering can't be ensured
  for all variants of subfigures, so it's neglected
